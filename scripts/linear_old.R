# Some thoughts:
# Will need to pick a time window when there are fewer gaps. Daily will result in lots of fluctuations, necessarily.
# How do we determine which pairs to look at? Don't want to exclude pairs that e.g. had a strong relationship at the beginning and then petered out. Maybe need a certain number of days/periods over the whole season?
