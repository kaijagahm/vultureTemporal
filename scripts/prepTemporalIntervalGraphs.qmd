dim(summer23)
```

## Cut Summer 2023 into different time windows

### Define the time windows

To test how the networks behave over different time intervals, we can prepare a subset of data (summer 2023) cut into different intervals. E.g. 1 day, 5 days, 10 days, 25 days, 50 days.

```{r}
#| include: false
# What are the different time windows we want to test?
timewindows <- c(1, 5, 10, 25, 50)

# A function for cutting a vector of dates (`vec`) into `days`-day intervals
cutdates <- function(vec, days){
  # get min and max dates in the vector
  min <- min(vec)
  max <- max(vec)
  
  # determine how many cutpoints we'll need
  ncutpoints <- ceiling(as.numeric(max-min)/days) + 1
  
  # create the vector of cutpoints
  cutpoints <- seq(from = min, by = days, length.out = ncutpoints)
  
  # cut the dates according to the cutpoints. Intervals will have the format [low, high).
  out <- cut(vec, breaks = cutpoints, include.lowest = T, right = F)
  return(out)
}

# Cut the data into the various intervals
data_cut <- map(timewindows, ~{
  summer23 %>%
    mutate(int = cutdates(dateOnly, .x))
})

length(data_cut) # should be same length as `timewindows` vector

# Okay, now we have the data classified into intervals, time to split each one into a list.
# There is an annoying thing here: when you have an sf object and you run group_by() %>% group_split() on it, the resulting sub-objects do not keep their sf status. They turn into regular data frames. Grrrrr! So I had to add a step to turn each of them back into an sf object.
data_cut <- map(data_cut, ~.x %>% 
                  group_by(int) %>% 
                  group_split() %>%
                  map(., ~sf::st_as_sf(.x, coords = c("location_long", "location_lat"), crs = "WGS84", remove = F)))

length(data_cut) # 5 elements, one for each of the time windows
map_dbl(data_cut, length) # each element has a different number of elements--122 for the 1-day intervals, 25 for the 5-day intervals, etc. etc.

save(data_cut, file = here("data/data_cut.Rda"))
```

Now we we need to do the same cuts for the roost data.

```{r}
#| include: false
roosts_summer23 <- roosts[[9]]

roosts_cut <- map(timewindows, ~{
  roosts_summer23 %>%
    mutate(int = cutdates(roost_date, .x))
})

roosts_cut <- map(roosts_cut, ~.x %>% 
                    group_by(int) %>% 
                    group_split() %>%
                    map(., ~sf::st_as_sf(.x, coords = c("location_long", "location_lat"), crs = "WGS84", remove = F)))

save(roosts_cut, file = here("data/roosts_cut.Rda"))
```

## Get flight, feeding, and roosting edges for each time window

I am using an unholy combination of for loops and `purrr::map()` here, because I find it easier to understand than nested `map` statements (and nested for loops are slower/not easy to parallelize). But they are doing the same thing.

```{r}
#| include: false

future::plan(future::multisession, workers = 15)

# Initialize lists to hold the outputs of get*Edges.
sris_flight <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
sris_feeding <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
sris_roosting <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))

# Run a for loop across all the time windows
for(i in 1:length(timewindows)){
  cat("Working on data split into", timewindows[i], "day intervals\n")
  
  datalist <- data_cut[[i]]
  roostlist <- roosts_cut[[i]]
  cat("Working on flight\n")
  fl <- suppressWarnings(furrr::future_map(datalist, ~{
    library(sf) # have to have this here; it's a quirk of future::map().
    vultureUtils::getFlightEdges(.x, roostPolygons = roostPolygons, distThreshold = 1000, idCol = "Nili_id", return = "sri")

  cat("Working on feeding\n")
  fe <- suppressWarnings(furrr::future_map(datalist, ~{
    library(sf) # have to have this here; it's a quirk of future::map().
    vultureUtils::getFeedingEdges(.x, roostPolygons = roostPolygons, distThreshold = 50, idCol = "Nili_id", return = "sri")
  }, .progress = T))

                                dateCol = "roost_date")
    
  }, .progress = T))

  sris_roosting[[i]] <- ro
  
  # Clean up memory
  rm(list = c("datalist", "roostlist", "fl", "fe", "ro"))
  gc()
}

# Now we have a problem where some of them have length 0 because there were no interactions of that type during the time interval in question. 
# I want to fill in those with a blank data frame with the same format as the other SRI data frames.
# Function to create empty SRI data frames:
fix <- function(data){

  return(sri)
}

for(i in 1:length(timewindows)){
  # In order to fix this, we will need access to the sri objects to check (result of the above) as well as the original data

  # For each sri output, check whether it's blank, and if so, fill it in with an empty data frame (i.e. "fix" it). If it's not blank, just leave it as is.
  flight_sris_fixed <- map2(sri_flight, data_flight, ~{
    if(nrow(.x) > 0){out <- .x}
    else{out <- fix(.y)}
    return(out)
  })
  feeding_sris_fixed <- map2(sri_feeding, data_feeding, ~{
    if(nrow(.x) > 0){out <- .x}
    else{out <- fix(.y)}
    return(out)
  })
  roosting_sris_fixed <- map2(sri_roosting, data_roosting, ~{
    if(nrow(.x) > 0){out <- .x}
    else{out <- fix(.y)}
    return(out)
  })
  
  # Save the results to their lists (overwriting what was there before)

  # Clean up memory

```

## Make the network graphs

```{r}
#| include: false
# Create lists to store the network graphs
graphs_flight <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
graphs_feeding <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
graphs_roosting <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))

# Set up a "plan" to run this code in parallel, so it will go much faster
future::plan(future::multisession, workers = 15)

# For each time window, loop through the edge lists and turn them into graphs
for(i in 1:length(timewindows)){
  flight <- sris_flight[[i]]
  feeding <- sris_feeding[[i]]
  roosting <- sris_roosting[[i]]
  flightgraphs <- furrr::future_map(flight, ~vultureUtils::makeGraph(mode = "sri", data = .x, weighted = T),
                                    .progress = T)
  feedinggraphs <- furrr::future_map(feeding, ~vultureUtils::makeGraph(mode = "sri", data = .x, weighted = T),
                                     .progress = T)
  roostinggraphs <- furrr::future_map(roosting, ~vultureUtils::makeGraph(mode = "sri", data = .x, weighted = T), .progress = T)
  
  # Fill the lists with the created graphs

  # Clean up memory

```

## Calculate individual-level metrics

In order to properly label the metrics in the data frame, we need to know which interval they're associated with. Let's retrieve the interval names from the original data.

```{r}
#| include: false
brks <- map(data_cut, ~map_chr(.x, ~as.character(.x$int[1])))
brks_roosts <- map(roosts_cut, ~map_chr(.x, ~as.character(.x$int[1])))
identical(brks, brks_roosts) # FALSE--this is a problem. Must mean we were missing some roost data. #XXX investigate...
```

```{r}
#| include: false
# Function to get degree and strength
getmetrics <- function(graph, interval, type, days){
  if(length(graph) > 0){
      metrics <- data.frame(degree = igraph::degree(graph),
                    strength = igraph::strength(graph),
                    Nili_id = names(igraph::degree(graph)),
                    int = interval,
                    n = length(V(graph)),
                    type = type,
                    ndays = days)
  }else{
    metrics <- data.frame(degree = NA, strength = NA, 
                          Nili_id = NA, int = interval, 
                          n = 0, type = type, ndays = days)
  }

  return(metrics)
}

# Initialize lists to hold the metrics
metrics_flight_indiv <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
metrics_feeding_indiv <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
metrics_roosting_indiv <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))

# Calculate metrics for each graph, using the getmetrics function defined above.
for(i in 1:length(timewindows)){
  metrics_flight_indiv[[i]] <- map2(graphs_flight[[i]], brks[[i]], ~{
    getmetrics(graph = .x, interval = .y, type = "flight", days = timewindows[i])
  })
  metrics_feeding_indiv[[i]] <- map2(graphs_feeding[[i]], brks[[i]], ~{
    getmetrics(.x, .y, "feeding", timewindows[i])
  })
  metrics_roosting_indiv[[i]] <- map2(graphs_roosting[[i]], brks_roosts[[i]], ~{
    getmetrics(.x, .y, "roosting", timewindows[i])
  })
}

# Smoosh the lists down into data frames instead (so now, instead of a list of lists, we will have a list of data frames)
metrics_flight_indiv_df <- map(metrics_flight_indiv, ~purrr::list_rbind(.x))
metrics_feeding_indiv_df <- map(metrics_feeding_indiv, ~purrr::list_rbind(.x))
metrics_roosting_indiv_df <- map(metrics_roosting_indiv, ~purrr::list_rbind(.x))

# smoosh the lists further into data frames (one data frame for each social situation), and bind all the situations together into a single data frame. We can do this because we specified "type" in the for loop above, so all the data is already labeled.
metrics_indiv <- bind_rows(purrr::list_rbind(metrics_flight_indiv_df), 
                     purrr::list_rbind(metrics_feeding_indiv_df), 
                     purrr::list_rbind(metrics_roosting_indiv_df))
row.names(metrics_indiv) <- NULL
metrics_indiv <- metrics_indiv %>%
  group_by(ndays, int) %>%
  mutate(normDegree = degree/(n-1),
         normStrength = strength/sum(strength, na.rm = T))
save(metrics_indiv, file = here("data/metrics_indiv.Rda"))
```

## Attach metrics to graphs

I'm going to use the structure called `tbl_graph` from the `tidygraph` package, because it makes attaching node or edge characteristics much easier than igraph (using the tidyverse framework).

```{r}
#| include: false
# Create lists to store the tbl_graph objects
graphs_flight_tbl <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
graphs_feeding_tbl <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
graphs_roosting_tbl <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))

# Fill the lists: convert each graph to a tbl_graph, and then join the metrics calculated above.
for(i in 1:length(timewindows)){
  fl_tbl <- map(graphs_flight[[i]], ~as_tbl_graph(.x))
  fe_tbl <- map(graphs_feeding[[i]], ~as_tbl_graph(.x))
  ro_tbl <- map(graphs_roosting[[i]], ~as_tbl_graph(.x))
  
  graphs_flight_tbl[[i]] <- map2(fl_tbl, metrics_flight_indiv[[i]], ~{
    .x %>% activate(nodes) %>%
      left_join(.y, by = c("name" = "Nili_id"))
  })
  graphs_feeding_tbl[[i]] <- map2(fe_tbl, metrics_feeding_indiv[[i]], ~{
    .x %>% activate(nodes) %>%
      left_join(.y, by = c("name" = "Nili_id"))
  })
  graphs_roosting_tbl[[i]] <- map2(ro_tbl, metrics_roosting_indiv[[i]], ~{
    .x %>% activate(nodes) %>%
      left_join(.y, by = c("name" = "Nili_id"))
  })
}

# Save the tbl_graphs with attached metrics to files
save(graphs_flight_tbl, file = here("data/graphs_flight_tbl.Rda"))
save(graphs_feeding_tbl, file = here("data/graphs_feeding_tbl.Rda"))
save(graphs_roosting_tbl, file = here("data/graphs_roosting_tbl.Rda"))
```

## Spatial centroids

Note that these won't be the centroids of the interactions, but rather of the individuals' movements more generally. Let's take the original data from which the networks were derived and compute spatial centroids for each time interval (so, daily, 2-day, 5-day, etc.). Then we can attach these to the networks and hopefully use that to plot some network graphs, positioning individuals by where they actually were.

For the co-roosting networks, we can either position the individuals by their spatial centroids during the day, or more interestingly, we can position them by their actual roosting coordinates. Actually in general it would probably be good to change the co-roosting networks to use distance instead of shared polygons. (XXX come back to this, 3/14)

### By interval

```{r}
#data_cut
interval_centroids <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(timewindows))
for(i in 1:length(interval_centroids)){
  interval_centroids[[i]] <- furrr::future_map(data_cut[[i]], ~{
    library(sf) # have to do this so that furrr will work
    .x %>%
      dplyr::select(Nili_id, int) %>%
      dplyr::group_by(Nili_id, int) %>%
      dplyr::summarize(sf::st_union(geometry), .groups = "drop") %>%
      sf::st_centroid() %>%
      bind_cols(as.data.frame(st_coordinates(.))) %>%
      st_drop_geometry() %>%
      rename("X_int" = X,
             "Y_int" = Y)
  }, .progress = T)
}
```

#### Bounding boxes

```{r}
interval_centroids_all <- map(interval_centroids, purrr::list_rbind)
per_interval_bboxes <- map2(interval_centroids_all, timewindows, ~{
  df <- data.frame(timewindow = .y,
                   xmin = min(.x$X_int)-(sd(.x$X_int)/10),
                   xmax = max(.x$X_int)+(sd(.x$X_int)/10),
                   ymin = min(.x$Y_int)-(sd(.x$Y_int)/10),
                   ymax = max(.x$Y_int)+(sd(.x$Y_int)/10))
  return(df)
})
```

### Overall

```{r}
overall_centroids <- data_cut[[1]] %>% purrr::list_rbind() %>%
  sf::st_as_sf(., coords = c("location_long", "location_lat"), 
               crs = "WGS84", remove = F) %>%
  group_by(Nili_id) %>%
  summarize(sf::st_union(geometry), .groups = "drop") %>%
  sf::st_centroid() %>%
  bind_cols(as.data.frame(sf::st_coordinates(.))) %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>%
  rename("X_overall" = X,
         "Y_overall" = Y)
```

#### Bounding box

```{r}
overall_bbox <- data.frame(xmin = min(overall_centroids$X_overall)-(sd(overall_centroids$X_overall)/10),
                           xmax = max(overall_centroids$X_overall)+(sd(overall_centroids$X_overall)/10),
                           ymin = min(overall_centroids$Y_overall)-(sd(overall_centroids$Y_overall)/10),
                           ymax = max(overall_centroids$Y_overall)+(sd(overall_centroids$Y_overall)/10))
```
