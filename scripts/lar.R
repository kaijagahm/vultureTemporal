# LAR/LRA
# Inventing a new lagged association rate measure for data that isn't group-by-individual
# (asnipe is designed to work with group-by-individual matrices)

library(tidyverse)

# One definition of LARs (note: not LRAs) is "the probability that two individuals re-associate a given number of days from their first observed instance of association" (Sunga et al. 2024)
# Another definition: "Standardized lagged association rates (SLAR) were determined for the entire study period to assess the stability of these relationships. The SLAR g'(t) of a dyad consisting of sharks a and b is an estimate of the average probability that, after a given time lag (t), a randomly selected associate of a will be b, with false absences accounted for according to Whitehead (2008a) and standard errors estimated using jackknifing (Whitehead, 2009)." (Armansin et al. 2016)

# How can we define this at all so that it makes sense for GPS data, or for SRI's that we've already calculated?
## Start from a time period t where (a, b) exists. Pick one to focus on.
## Go to the next time period t+1. sri(a, b)/strength(a) = "probability that, after a given time lag (t), a randomly selected associate of a will be b".
## Then we have to somehow average that over all times when they are interacting... hmm. I don't love that the initial determination of the dyad (a, b) in time period t is binary, and then we incorporate the SRI's only for time t+1.
## Actually, I guess the initial t has to be the first time that a and b ever interact. But how do we know we've captured the first time?

# I can't tell if these results are real (i.e. that there just aren't that many differences in reassociation probability over this timescale at all) or if there's something wrong with how I'm calculating this. Really would need to test the method on a simulation to confirm that it's working as intended, but I don't think I have time to do that.
