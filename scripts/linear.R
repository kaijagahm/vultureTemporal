# Some thoughts:
# Will need to pick a time window when there are fewer gaps. Daily will result in lots of fluctuations, necessarily.
# How do we determine which pairs to look at? Don't want to exclude pairs that e.g. had a strong relationship at the beginning and then petered out. Maybe need a certain number of days/periods over the whole season?

# I wonder: what does the cumulative number of relationships look like when you look at number of non-zero days vs. number of relationships, for a given individual?
## We can actually answer that question with a cumulative sum graph for each individual. Just have to be careful when aggregating by individual, since the information right now is dyad-level. In order to make the data individual-level, I think we need to double it and flip it around...
